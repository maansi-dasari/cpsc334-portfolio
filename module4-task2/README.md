## Project Components
This project uses the following circuit components:
- ESP32 and power supply
- Switch
- Piezoelectric sensor
- LED (x4)
- Stepper motor
- Servo motor

## How to use
To run this project, plug the circuit components into the ESP32 according to the pin numbers specified at the top of `disco_ball/disco_ball.ino`. Then, power on the ESP32 and upload the code found in `disco_ball.ino`. Turn the switch to the "on" position to begin the motion. Once started, the disco ball with spin continously in a single direction, and the "dancing man" emoji will sway back and forth. The LED lights will flash when the box is tapped.
